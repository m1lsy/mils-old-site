        <h6> Personal Leadership </h6>
        <div class="perleatext">
          Regarding personal leadership, I sometimes tend to lack self motivation, however this semester I have focused on having the 
          ability to identify and seize opportunities. I did this through asking others for feedback and learning from others. Whether
           this be asking for various peoples opinions on something I am working on or looking at what others are working on as examples 
          or inspirations for my own work. By remaining open to feedback, I am recognizing and addressing my own learning needs,
           and engaging in reflective practices to enhance personal growth. 
           Reflection: One problem that I have encountered within this learning outcome
            is that I tend to not ask for feedback as often as I should, despite recognizing its importance. This is due to me adjusting
            to this new and very different system of learning where feedback is not just received and that I have to seek feedback and ask 
            for it in order to get it. I also did not understand how important recording the feedback I received was, and that I should not
             just listen to the feedback but that I should write it down for future reflection. Unfortunately, I only came to this 
             realisation at the end of the semester and thus I feel that I am lacking in evidence of this learning outcome. 
             In my future semesters, I hope to make more use of Feedpulse and I aim to engage more with my teachers. Despite this problem,
              I still received very helpful feedback through out the semester from both my teachers and fellow students which was a great 
            help to my work.</div>

          In the realm of investigative problem-solving,
           my approach has been marked by possessing a set of skills and a certain attitude related to addressing problems
            in a systematic and inquisitive manner. To demonstate these aspects, I recognize the importance of questioning throughout 
            the solution process, by not just accepting information given to me but probing deeper to gain a comprehensive understanding 
            of the information I am taking in. This involves using different approaches to find a solution based on the nature of the 
            problem. These various approaches include pragmatic problem-solving, critical thinking and the use of sources.
             Pragmatic problem solving involves being practical and realistic and is about finding solutions that are feasible and
              effective in the given context. Critical thinking means I need to assess information critically, evaluate its reliability, 
              and make informed decisions. This involves analysing the evidence, identifying assumptions, and considering alternative 
              perspectives before coming to a conclusion. Lastly, through using sources and researching information, I am able to find 
              credible and reliable information to support problem-solving efforts. These approaches help me get a holistic understanding 
              of the problem by considering different aspects and factors and going beyond the surface to understand the interconnected
               elements of a situation.</div>

        <h6> Targeted Interaction </h6>
        <div class="tarinttext">
            In the domain of targeted interaction, I have consistently considered the direct stakeholders when working on assignments. 
            I am mindful of communication strategies, paying attention to what I convey and how it is presented. In group settings,
             I recognize and fulfill my role, actively addressing tasks and responsibilities within the team. Moreover, 
             I engage with my peers, providing constructive feedback on their behavior and encouraging a collaborative and 
             supportive group dynamic. This targeted interaction ensures effective teamwork and contributes to a positive and 
             productive group environment.
